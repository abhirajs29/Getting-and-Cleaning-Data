# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project (JHU) Coursera
 
Description
-----------
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate data collection, data manipulation, and data cleaning. The goal is to prepare tidy data to be used for later analysis. Submitions include: 1) a **tidy data set** as described below, 2) a **link** to a Github repository with script for performing the analysis, and 3) a **code book** that describes the **variables**, **the data**, and **any transformations or work** that was performed to clean up the data called **CodeBook.md**.

Objective
-----------
1. Merge training and test sets to create one data set.
2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
